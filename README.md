# Calendar
In this project, we'll build a basic calendar that the user will be able to interact with from the command line. 
The user should be able to choose to:  
1. View the calendar 
2. Add an event to the calendar 
3. Update an existing event 
4. Delete an existing event 

The program does following:  
1. Print a welcome message to the user 
2. Prompt the user to view, add, update, or delete an event on the calendar 
3. Depending on the user's input: view, add, update, or delete an event on the calendar 
4. The program should never terminate unless the user decides to exit.
